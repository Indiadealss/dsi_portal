A home loan EMI calculator helps compute the monthly instalments that a borrower needs to pay against the total amount availed. Such a tool assists you in making an informed decision about the outflow towards the home loan every month.


To identify your home loan EMI, you need to fill in the following -

Loan Amount: The total amount that you need to avail for your property.
Loan Tenure: You would be required to furnish the desired loan term (in years). A longer tenure helps in reducing the monthly EMI.
Interest Rate: Input interest rate.
